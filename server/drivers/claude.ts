// Claude Code, driven as a subprocess.
//
// The CLI is run once per turn with JSON on both ends of the pipe: the
// prompt goes in on stdin as a stream-json message, and a sequence of
// stream-json events comes back on stdout. Stdin stays open while the
// turn runs, so the person can say more and the agent reads it after the
// step it is on (GitHub 213); closing it is what lets a -p process end,
// so it is closed at the first result. Continuity across turns is the
// CLI's own `--resume`, keyed on a session id it hands us in its first
// event, which we store as the thread's resume cursor.
//
// Why per-turn rather than one long-lived process: a turn is the unit that
// can be interrupted, and a process is the only thing that reliably stops
// when told to. Killing the group at the end also reaps the MCP servers it
// spawned, which a persistent process would leak.
//
// Three MCP servers may be attached to a run, all of them ours:
//   bloks      the permission bridge, so the agent can ask the user
//   computer   the agent's cloud desktop, or this Mac
//   composio   whatever third-party accounts are connected
