// Rehearsals: an agent does the work on a copy, and you decide.
//
// Undo (server/checkpoints.ts) takes a mistake back after it landed. A
// rehearsal stops it landing at all. The agent's folder is cloned, the
// turn runs in the clone in a lane of its own, and what it changed comes
// back as the same card undo uses, with Apply and Discard instead of
// Undo. Apply writes the changes into the real folder file by file, and
// only onto files that are still as they were when the rehearsal began;
// anything you changed meanwhile is left alone and named. After that the
// card undoes like any other.
//
// Compare is the same thing more than once: the same task, in the same
// folder, handed to two or three agents at once, each in its own clone.
// Keeping one attempt discards the rest.
//
// The clone is copy-on-write where the filesystem can do it (APFS on a
// Mac, reflinks on Btrfs and XFS), so a large project copies in a moment
// and costs almost no disk until something changes. Elsewhere it is a
// plain copy, which the size limits in checkpoints.ts keep sane.
//
// What a rehearsal does not contain is anything outside the folder. A
// command that sends an email or pushes a branch is as real in a
// rehearsal as anywhere; the agent is told so, and approvals still ask.
