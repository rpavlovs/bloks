// Turns cut off in the middle, and picking them up again (GitHub 160).
//
// Two things cut a turn off without it being anybody's decision: the Mac
// going to sleep, and Bloks itself stopping (a quit, an update, a crash).
// Both are picked up the same way. The person reads a notice saying what
// happened, and the agent is told, separately, to carry on and to check
// what already happened before repeating anything. Neither is a new
// message from the person, and neither repeats what they asked.
//
// Sleep is noticed while Bloks is still running, so it is kept in memory
// (server/index.ts, sleptLanes). A stop is not noticed at all, which is
// why every turn is written here when it starts and taken out when it
// ends: whatever is still here when Bloks starts was cut off, whether the
// last run ended in a clean quit or a crash. No shutdown hook is needed,
// and none could be trusted to run.
//
// The file is small and rewritten whole, through a temporary file and a
// rename, so a crash mid-write leaves the old list rather than half of a
// new one.
