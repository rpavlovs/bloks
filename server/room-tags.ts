/**
 * Room lines addressed to an agent while it was mid-turn. Skipping a busy
 * agent used to drop the line: it was in the transcript, nobody woke for
 * it, and the room read as the agent choosing not to answer. Delivered
 * when the agent is free.
 *
 * Lines wait per agent, room and requester. Lines from one requester in
 * one room join into one turn; lines from different requesters never do,
 * because who asked decides whose approvals a turn runs under and whose
 * spend it is booked to (a member's line must not ride on the owner's).
 *
 * Given a file, they are kept on disk as well, the way a lane's queued
 * messages are kept in its transcript, so a restart does not lose them:
 * above all one Bloks drained for (server/drain.ts), which holds every
 * room line until it is back. Read back only within the window a queued
 * message has (MAX_QUEUED_RECOVERY_MS), for the same reason: waiting is
 * not standing permission to act.
