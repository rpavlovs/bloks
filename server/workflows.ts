// Work with more than one step in it, and a place for a person to say yes.
//
// A routine wakes an agent on a clock. A job hands one piece of work to
// whoever suits it. Neither can express the thing people actually keep
// describing: when this happens, have somebody look at it, and if it
// turns out to matter, ask me before doing anything about it.
//
// That is three ideas, and each is small on its own. A trigger that is
// not a clock. Steps that pass values along. A step that stops and waits
// for a person. The difficulty is entirely in the third one, so the shape
// of everything here is chosen to make the third one work.
//
// The decision the rest follows from: a run is state on disk, advanced by
// a tick. It is never a chain of promises held open in memory. A run
// parked on an approval is a row in a file saying which step it stopped
// at and when it stops waiting; answering it is a fresh advance from that
// row rather than a callback firing inside a closure that has been alive
// for two days. Suspending a run in memory works beautifully until the
// app quits, which is exactly when somebody is out and the approval has
// been sitting there since yesterday.
//
// Two things left out on purpose.
//
//   No step that calls out to the internet. It is the obvious fourth
//   action and it is a hole: a workflow that can post anywhere is a way
//   to move a workspace's contents off this machine on a trigger, and
//   that needs a permission story of its own rather than a text field.
//
//   No regular expressions in conditions. Everything else here evaluates
//   nothing, which is why there is no sandbox and no time budget: there
//   is nothing that can run away. A regex is the single operator that
//   would have brought that problem back, and "contains" covers what
//   people actually write.
