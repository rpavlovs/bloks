// How full a conversation is, and what to do when it fills.
//
// A model can only be told so much at once. Until now this was handled by
// sending the last forty messages and letting the rest fall off the back,
// which is the worst version of both options: the agent quietly forgets
// what was said an hour ago, nobody is told, and on a small model forty
// long messages can still be too many.
//
// So: measure, show, and when it fills, summarise the old part and carry
// on. Three rules the rest of this file exists to keep.
//
//   Nothing is dropped silently. What falls out of the window is
//   summarised into the conversation, and the summary is a message people
//   can read rather than a hidden state.
//
//   Pressure is a fact about a lane, not about an agent. Two lanes on the
//   same agent are two conversations and fill up separately.
//
//   Being wrong about a limit costs a summary, never a broken thread. If
//   the guess is low we compact early; if it is high the provider says so
//   and that is recoverable too, which is why the error is recognised
//   rather than surfaced as a failed turn.
//
// Everything here is pure.
