// What an agent changed, and the way back.
//
// Before a turn, the folder the agent works in is photographed; after it,
// photographed again. The difference is what the turn did to your files,
// shown as a card in the conversation with a diff per file and one button
// to put it all back.
//
// Our own store rather than git. Git would give diffs for free, but on a
// Mac without the developer tools, /usr/bin/git is a stub that pops an
// installer dialog, and "an agent turn opened a system dialog" is not a
// trade worth making for a diff. So this is content addressed the same
// way git is, without being git: every file version is kept once, by its
// sha256, and a photograph is a list of paths and hashes. A file that has
// not moved since the last photograph (same size, same mtime) is not read
// again, which is what keeps the second photograph of a folder cheap.
//
// Undo is careful rather than forceful. A file is put back only if it is
// still exactly what the turn left behind. If you or a later turn changed
// it since, it is left alone and named, because quietly throwing away
// work done after the fact is the one thing an undo must never do.
//
// A folder can be shared, by several agents or by two conversations of
// one, and a turn that ran beside another one there cannot tell from two
// photographs whose writes were whose (GitHub 153). So a turn knows which
// other turns overlapped it in the same folder, or one inside the other,
// and keeps as its own only the files its engine said it edited. The rest
// are on its card apart, as changed while others were working here, and
// Undo leaves them alone: undoing another agent's work is the same harm
// as undoing a later turn's. A turn that ran alone claims everything, as
// it always did.
//
// Limits, all of them deliberate: folders too big to photograph in a
// moment are not tracked (the card says so rather than pretending), files
// over MAX_FILE are noted as changed but not kept, and a handful of
// directories that are regenerated rather than written (node_modules and
// friends) are skipped.
//
// What a repository ignores is skipped too: logs and build output are not
// the turn's work, and an undo that deletes fresh logs and puts old build
// output back helps nobody. Git is only asked when it is really there
// (never the macOS stub), and matching .gitignore ourselves is a trap, so
// without Git the folder is photographed whole, as before.
