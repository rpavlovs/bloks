// What is happening right now, and what it is costing.
//
// A workspace with ten agents in it accumulates work nobody is watching. A
// routine fires into a background lane at nine in the morning. A job is
// offered to three agents in turn and one of them takes it. A workflow
// parks on an approval and waits a day for an answer. Each of those is
// visible, but only from the surface that owns it, and only if you think
// to go and look.
//
// So this is one place that answers two questions. What is running, and
// what is waiting on me. Everything it shows is already tracked somewhere
// else; the work here is joining it up and saying why each thing is
// happening, which is the part nothing else does.
//
// Three decisions.
//
//   Waiting comes before running. A turn that is working needs nothing
//   from anybody, and a card that has been open since yesterday does. An
//   overlay that sorted by start time would bury the only rows that
//   actually want a person.
//
//   Every row says what set it off. "Sage is busy" is the fact the sidebar
//   already gives you; "Sage is busy because the 9am routine fired" is the
//   one worth opening a panel for, and it is the only thing here that
//   cannot be read off any single store.
//
//   Cost is what was spent, never what is left. Same rule as
//   server/usage.ts, for the same reason: Bloks does not resell tokens, so
//   the ceiling belongs to whoever you signed in with and inventing a
//   denominator would be a lie. Today's spend is the honest number.
