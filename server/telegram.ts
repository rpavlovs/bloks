// Reaching your agents from a phone you have not installed anything on.
//
// The iPhone app is the better answer for people who want an app. This
// is for the rest of it: a borrowed phone, an Android, a laptop in
// somebody else's kitchen. You message a bot, an agent answers, and the
// conversation lands in the same thread as everything else.
//
// It runs on this Mac and talks to Telegram directly. No relay, nothing
// new listening on a port, and no inbound connection at all: long
// polling means the machine asks Telegram whether anything arrived,
// which is the same direction of travel as every other call the app
// makes and needs no router touched.
//
// Two things carry the security of it, and both are deliberate.
//
//   Nobody who is not on the list gets an answer. A bot's username is
//   discoverable, so anybody can message it. An unknown chat is refused
//   once, plainly, and never reaches an agent: without that, a stranger
//   would be talking to something with a shell on this machine.
//
//   The first person to say the pairing word owns the bot. Chat ids are
//   not guessable and there is no directory of them, so the honest way
//   to learn yours is to have you send it. The word is single use and
//   the pairing closes behind it.
