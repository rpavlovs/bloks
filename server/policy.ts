// Rules a person writes about what their agents may do.
//
// An agent partway through a turn asks before anything consequential, and
// item 10 records the answer. That works and it does not scale: the
// hundredth "may I read this file" is the same decision as the first, and
// a person who answers a hundred cards stops reading them, which is worse
// than not asking.
//
// So the questions get answered by rules first, and only what the rules do
// not cover reaches a person. Five decisions, four of them borrowed and
// one of them ours.
//
//   Deny is evaluated before allow, and deny wins. An operator can then
//   reason about what is forbidden without reading every allow rule
//   written since, and a broad allow added later cannot quietly reopen
//   something that was shut.
//
//   The target is read here, from what the engine actually sent, rather
//   than taken as a label. A rule about a path has to be checked against
//   the path the tool was given, or renaming the thing gets past the rule.
//
//   Nothing that cannot be evaluated is permitted. A rule with an operator
//   this build does not know cannot be shown not to apply, so a deny with
//   one denies and an allow with one does not allow.
//
//   Rules compare, they never evaluate. The same call as item 20: there is
//   no expression language here, so there is no sandbox to get wrong and
//   nothing that can run away. It also means a rule is a form rather than
//   a syntax, which is the difference between a person writing one and a
//   person being told they could.
//
// And the one that is ours rather than theirs. **No rules means ask, not
// deny.** A gateway that is the only way through is right to refuse what
// it was told nothing about. Here the thing an empty policy replaces is a
// person deciding, and quietly refusing everything the day somebody opens
// this screen would be a worse product and a worse default. Fail closed
// applies inside a rule, never to the absence of one.
//
// Questions are never governed. An agent asking its owner something is not
// an action, and a rule that answered it would be inventing an answer.
