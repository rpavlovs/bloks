// Routines: work an agent does on a schedule instead of when you ask.
//
// An agent that checks something every morning is worth more than one you
// have to remember to ask, which is the whole reason this exists.
//
// The schedule is deliberately a time of day plus days of the week rather
// than cron. Cron is more expressive and nobody can read it on a phone at
// arm's length, and "every weekday at 09:00" covers essentially every
// routine anyone actually writes.
//
// Two behaviours are worth understanding before changing anything here:
//
//   A missed run fires once, not N times. The Mac sleeps. When it wakes,
//   the routine fires for the slot it missed rather than once per slot
//   since the machine went down, which is how you get an agent doing your
//   morning brief eleven times.
//
//   A run missed by more than the grace window is skipped entirely. A
//   "brief me at 09:00" that fires at 23:40 because the lid was shut all
//   day is not a brief, it is a surprise. The next one comes tomorrow.
