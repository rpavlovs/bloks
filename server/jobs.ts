// A job board: work posted without naming who does it.
//
// With one agent you talk to it. With six, saying the same thing six
// times to find out who is the right one is worse than having one, and
// picking yourself means you have to hold what each of them is for. So a
// job is posted to nobody in particular, and an agent takes it.
//
// Taking it is real rather than decorative. The board ranks who looks
// suited from what they are for and what they can do, offers it to the
// best of them, and that agent may decline: an agent that says it is not
// their kind of work hands the job back and it goes to the next. What a
// person sees is who took it, what they said, and what came of it.
//
// The ranking is a plain word overlap rather than a model call. It is
// good enough to order six agents by relevance, it costs nothing, and it
// cannot fail: an offer is a proposal the agent gets to refuse, so the
// consequence of ranking badly is one wasted turn rather than a wrong
// answer.
