// An agent as an identity rather than a row with a name on it.
//
// Until now "which agent did this" was a string in a record, and a string
// in a record is only as good as the thing that wrote it. A name can be
// edited, two agents can share one, and an entry saying "Ivy did this" is
// a claim by whatever appended the entry rather than by Ivy.
//
// So every agent holds a key. The private half never leaves this machine
// and is never shown; the public half is the agent's identity, and what
// it signs is checkable afterwards by anyone with the record. That is
// what turns "attributable" from a label into something a person can
// verify, and it is the half of the audit trail item 10 could not do on
// its own.
//
// Ed25519 because it is in the standard library, the keys are small
// enough to print, and there is nothing to configure. No passphrase: the
// key protects attribution inside a workspace, not the workspace itself,
// which is already only as private as the account it lives in.
