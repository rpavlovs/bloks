// Where things stand in the sidebar, kept here rather than on a device.
//
// The sidebar used to be arranged per device: the section order lived in
// one browser's storage, and inside a section the order was simply the
// order of the file. So the Mac and the phone drifted, and a team
// somebody wanted in a set order could not be put in one (GitHub 156).
//
// Three things are kept, all with the workspace:
//
//   The order of the sections, as the person dragged their headings.
//   It is a list of names here, because a section is only a name the
//   rows agree on (see src/lib/sections.ts); a name that stops being used
//   is simply skipped when the list is drawn.
//
//   Which rows are pinned, and where each stands among the pins of its
//   section. On the agent or room itself, beside `section`, as
//   `pinned` and `pinOrder`: one row, one write, and a row carried to
//   another device carries its place with it.
//
//   When each row last had something to do with the person
//   (`activeWithYouAt`, decided in server/activity.ts). Everything that
//   is not pinned sorts by it.
//
// The rule that turns those into an order is compareRows in
// src/lib/sections.ts, which is what the sidebar draws with. The server
// only ever needs its pinned half, to number the pins when one moves, and
// the copy of that half here is held to the client's by
// test/sidebar-order.test.ts.
