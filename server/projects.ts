// A project: a thing you switch into rather than a setting you change.
//
// We already had folders. An agent has one, a room has one, and a turn
// runs in whichever applies. What we did not have was the thing those
// belong to: a name, the folders it covers, the people on it, and the
// standing brief everybody working on it should have read.
//
// Two decisions shape the rest.
//
//   A project is a lens, not a container. Agents are not moved into it and
//   nothing is hidden from anyone; opening a project scopes what you are
//   looking at and gives its agents a folder and a brief. Closing it puts
//   everything back. Moving objects into containers is how a workspace
//   becomes a filing problem.
//
//   A folder that has gone is said out loud. A project carries a list of
//   working directories, and the thing that matters is what happens when
//   one of them moves: falling back to somewhere else is worse than
//   stopping, because an agent quietly writing into the wrong directory
//   is harder to notice than an agent refusing to start.
//
// The pure half is here. Reading the disk and running turns is the
// caller's problem.
